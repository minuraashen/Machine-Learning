# ðŸ§  My Machine Learning Journey  
A collection of beginner-level machine learning projects to build a strong foundation in supervised learning.  
I am still **learning** and have just begun my journey into **Machine Learning**.  
This repository contains my **beginner-level projects** as I explore and improve my skills.  
I wish to complete many **worthwhile projects** over time while continuously learning and growing.
